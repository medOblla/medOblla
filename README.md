Greetings, I'm a computer science student, with a bachelor degree in CS during those 36 months i was able to accumulate a good collection of skills and knowledge about this highly promising domain by taking online courses and contributing to a lot of projects which helped me develop a critical thinking and great ability of problem solving.
I like discovering new technologies and being up to date with the tech world, to offer more practical apps and services to the world.
